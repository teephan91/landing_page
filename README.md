# landing_page
## About
A typical homepage with its header, footer, and different sections in between. Each section will have a mixture of text, links, images, and buttons.

## Technology Used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)

## What I Did
Creating an entire webpage from scratch can be intimidating and overwhelming, especially for beginners. Therefore, I began this project by focusing on one section at a time, starting with its HTML then CSS. Only after finishing a particular section, I would then move on to the next one.

For this project, I got a chance to *"flex"* my layout muscles with **Flexbox**. It was quite difficult at first to grasp the concepts, especially the axes and their alignment. But with plenty of practice throughout the project, things got easier. The key here was to know where the main axis is and work from there. It actually helped to have a *"cheat sheet"* with images showing where the flex items would go when you implemented certain properties. For example, [justify-content: center;] would have a picture of the flex items positioning themselves in the middle. Horizontally if [flex-direction: row;] and vertically if [flex-direction: column;].

I had to google quite a bit for things like Flexbox properties, CSS declarations, Links-Visited-Hover-Active order, etc. So I learned to utilize many search operators to make my searches quicker and more efficient. And not to mention a few useful keyboard shortcuts. For example, **CMD/Ctrl + F** to find a specific keyword without reading through a wall of text. Or **CMD/Ctrl + R** to quickly reload your browser to see changes on the webpage. These were small little things, but they *tremendously* improved my workflow.

I too started to appreciate the **Chrome DevTools**. I used it to implement new codes to my webpage without modifying the source code. I like that DevTools showing me the padding, border, and margin of an element right on the page. It was quite handy for laying out different elements and making sure that they sit with each other nicely. Finally, DevTools helped me to figure out the CSS's cascading effect, with it conveniently crosses off the declarations that don't make it.

## What's Next?
The landing page looks good on computer's screen, but it doesn't on mobile devices'. So the next logical step is to make it mobile-friendly.
